We performed data augmentation based on a set of data samples from BPAEC to train the 3D network and achieved better network training results. 
The data samples used for specific experiments have been uploaded to the 'widefield' and 'groundtruth' folders.
From the theoretical point of view, it is possible to modify the network structure to get closer and more general experimental results, 
which is also the direction of our future endeavours.
